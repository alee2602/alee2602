### Hi there, I´m Mónica 👋

##⚡ I´m a third-year Computer Science student at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala

##🌱 I am quite disciplined and eager to learn. Currently, I am learning about mobile and web development.

##🔭 At the moment, my areas of interest are front-end development and data analysis, although I am looking to become proficient in being a full-stack developer.

##⚡ I like music a lot. I feel it describes, to a large extent, who I am as a person. I listen to a bit of everything, but my favorite genre is pop.
