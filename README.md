### Hi there, I'm Mónica 👋

⚡ I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala

🌱 I am quite self-disciplined and always eager to learn! Currently, I am learning about data mining and AI.

🔭 At the moment, my area of interest is data science.

🎹 I like music a lot. I feel it describes, to a large extent, who I am as a person.
